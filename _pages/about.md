## Who I am
<div id=""></div>

I am **Ravindu Tharanga Perera**, a Master of Science graduate in **Computer Science** from **Clemson University** with a concentration in **Data Science and Machine Learning**.  
Iâ€™m passionate about building **AI-driven and cloud-native solutions** that integrate intelligent automation into real-world systems.

Iâ€™ve conducted research in **Human-AI collaboration**, **LLM-powered assistants**, and **AI-enhanced XR workspaces** under the supervision of **Dr. Carlos Toxtli** at the *Human-AI Empowerment Lab*, Clemson School of Computing.  
My technical strengths include **AWS Cloud**, **Python**, **Docker**, **Snowflake**, **Power BI**, and **machine-learning model deployment**.

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my portfolio through hands-on **AWS Cloud Engineering projects**â€”such as scalable S3-CloudFront deployments, serverless architectures with Lambda + API Gateway, and CI/CD pipelines with ECS Fargate.
